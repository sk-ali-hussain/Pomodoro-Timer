## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Basic Process:

1. **Decide on the task** to be done.
2. **Set the Pomodoro timer** (25 minutes).
3. **Work on the task** until the timer rings.
4. **Take a short break** (5 minutes).
5. After four Pomodoros, **take a longer break** (15-30 minutes).
